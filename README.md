# Algorithms Cloud App

This project is an ongoing development that applies various algorithms from the book *Grokking Algorithms* to real-world examples. The goal is to create a cloud-based app that demonstrates each algorithm in action through practical use cases. The project will also incorporate Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Project Overview

The Algorithms Cloud App is built to help you study and visualize fundamental algorithms by incorporating them into a full-stack cloud application. This application will be used to demonstrate the impact and importance of algorithms in solving real-world problems.

## Algorithms Covered

This project will cover a variety of algorithms discussed in *Grokking Algorithms* and will provide real-world use cases where these algorithms can solve business or technical challenges. Examples include:

- **Search Algorithms** (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search)
- **Sorting Algorithms** (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A* Search)
- **Dynamic Programming** (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (e.g., Huffman Encoding, Activity Selection)
- **String Manipulation Algorithms** (e.g., Anagram Detection, Palindrome Checking)
- **Divide and Conquer** (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

## Project Goals

- **Study and Implement Algorithms**: Each algorithm from the book will be implemented and tested in the project. 
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Algorithms will be applied to solve specific business or technical problems, demonstrating their relevance.
- **Cloud App Deployment**: The project will be developed as a cloud application using modern frameworks and hosted on a cloud provider (AWS).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate CI/CD workflows to ensure automated testing, building, and deployment. 

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend**: React.js (for building interactive user interfaces)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Containerization**: Docker (for creating portable, scalable, and isolated environments)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools for automating workflows
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
